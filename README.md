# Minecraft Bedrock: Stone Age Overhaul

Welcome to the **Stone Age Overhaul**, a Minecraft Bedrock Edition addon that thrusts you into a primitive world with limited resources. Forget about diamonds and netherite — your survival depends on sticks, stones, and your own ingenuity.  
This addon is designed for players seeking a challenging and immersive early-game experience.

---

## 📜 Overview
This addon completely overhauls the vanilla Minecraft experience by removing almost all advanced technology and resources, forcing players to survive and thrive in a world that resembles the Stone Age.  

You will not find:
- Pre-built shelters  
- Hidden treasures  
- Easy access to metal  

Every tool and every meal is a hard-won achievement.

## ✨ Features

### ⛏️ Crafting Overhaul
- **Removed Recipes:** Nearly all recipes for items beyond the stone and wood tier have been disabled.  
  This includes:
  - Metal tools
  - Armor
  - Advanced blocks (furnaces, etc.)
  - Complex mechanical items
- **Back to Basics:** Master the use of wood, stone, and flint to create your essential tools.

---

### 🌍 A Desolate World
- **No More Freebies:** All loot chests in generated structures (dungeons, villages, temples, etc.) are empty. Gather every resource yourself.  
- **Barren Mobs:** Most mobs no longer drop their usual loot, forcing you to find alternative sources for materials.

---

### 🏹 New Dangers & Tools
- **Increased Hostility:** Nights are more dangerous — zombies and skeletons spawn in larger groups, making shelter a top priority.  
- **Throwable Rock:** A new primitive weapon crafted from a single piece of cobblestone, providing a basic ranged option for hunting and defense.
